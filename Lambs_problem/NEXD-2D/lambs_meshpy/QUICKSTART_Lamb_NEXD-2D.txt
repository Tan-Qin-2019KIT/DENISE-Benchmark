Quickstart to run Lambs problem with NEXD-2D using MeshPy grid generation

Minimum requirements:
---------------------
Intel Core i7 or similar AMD CPU with 8 cores
8 GB RAM

Fortran-Compiler: mpif90
MPI-library: OpenMPI
other libraries: - METIS version 4.0.3 - http://glaros.dtc.umn.edu/gkhome/metis/metis/overview
		 - Lapack
		 - Python packages, I recommend Anaconda: https://www.anaconda.com/download/#linux
		 - MeshPy for grid generation

Numpy/Scipy/Matplotlib/Paraview for seismic data and model visualization 

On NEC-cluster @ computing centre Kiel activate Lapack module by typing

module load lapack3.8.0

1. Clone NEXD-2D on your local machine

   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/seismology-RUB/NEXD-2D.git

2. Modify the compiler options in Makefile according to the used computer. 
   On the NEC-cluster replace:

   lib = metis-4.0.3/libmetis.a 
   
   by

   lib = /sfs/fs2/work-sh2/sungw331/libs/metis-4.0.3/libmetis.a

3. If you use Python 3.0+ replace in the python code /tools/scripts/makeDepFromUseInclude.py

   print entry

   by

   print(entry)

4. Clone Lambs problem with MeshPy grid generation on your local machine 

   git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/daniel-koehn/DENISE-Benchmark

5. Copy lambs_meshpy from DENISE-Benchmark/Lambs_problem to NEXD-2D/simulations

   cp -rf DENISE-Benchmark/Lambs_problem/lambs_meshpy NEXD-2D/simulations

6. By running the Jupyter notebook 

   meshpy_lambs_problem.ipynb

   in lambs_meshpy/meshpy you can generate all necessary NEXD-2D model files:

   absorb, coord, free, mat, matprop and mesh

   The mesh is created by the MeshPy TRIANGLE package. In the mesh plot free surface nodes are displayed in red 
   and absorbing boundary nodes in red, except for the nodes connecting free and absorbing boundary conditions.

7. Check the number of MPI-processes you want to use in data/parfile

   # Number of Processors
   nproc = 8     # depending on setup (currently max is 96)

8. By running the shell script 

   /lambs_meshpy/process.sh

   you create the internal NEXD-2D mesh and distribute it over the used MPI processes with METIS.
   You can check if the MeshPy model is correctly read by the NEXD-2D mesher by visualizing the 
   VTK file out/vp_model.vtk e.g. with Paraview. The METIS mesh distribution is printed in the 
   postscript files mesh0xx.ps

8. Run NEXD-2D on e.g. 8 cores by typing

   mpirun -np 8 bin/solver

   in /lambs_meshpy

9. Plot seismogram comparisons between the NEXD-2D, SPECFEM-2D and anaytical solutions with the Jupyter notebook

   /lambs_meshpy/NEXD-2D_plot_seis

10. Create a fancy wave propagation movie by typing 

    mpirun -np 8 bin/movie

11. The NEXD-2D movie output consists of multiple VTK files which can be displayed e.g. with Paraview

Congratulations, you just finished your first time-domain NEXD-2D modelling.
